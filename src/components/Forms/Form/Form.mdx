# Form

Using the `Form` component and the included Controlled form Elements makes building forms quick and easy, and does not required importing an external third-party library such as Formik or React Hook Form.

Under the hood, we use React Context to manage form state, which is automatically hooked up to our controlled form elements via our `useField` hook.

When using Typescript in your project, we recommend starting by defining an interface for your form's fields:

```ts
interface UserRegistrationFormValues {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  confirmPassword: string;
}
```

Then, create a default state for your form:

```ts
const defaultFormValues: UserRegistrationFormValues = {
  firstName: "",
  lastName: "",
  email: "",
  password: "",
  confirmPassword: "",
};
```

You can see that we used your field interface here to add some type safety to our default form values. Now we can build the form with our React components.

```tsx
export const UserRegistrationForm = () => {
  const handleSubmit = (values: UserRegistrationFormValues) => {
    // Call function to map / transform form values before passing to API.
  };

  return (
    <Form
      initialValues={defaultFormValues}
      handleSubmit={handleSubmit}
      actions={
        <>
          <Button type="submit" variant="filled" color="primary">
            Submit
          </Button>
          <Button type="reset">Cancel</Button>
        </>
      }
    >
      <ControlledInput name="firstName" label="First Name" split />
      <ControlledInput name="lastName" label="Last Name" split />
      <ControlledInput name="email" label="Email Address" />
      <ControlledInput name="password" label="Password" />
      <ControlledInput name="confirmPassword" label="Confirm Password" />
    </Form>
  );
};
```
